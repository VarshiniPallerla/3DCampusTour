# üè´ 3D Campus Simulation using OpenGL

The **3D graphical representation of a university campus** project is a computer graphics application developed using **OpenGL** to simulate a realistic and interactive tour of a college campus. The primary objective is to provide users with a dynamic visualization of campus life, including moving students, vehicles, and interconnected roads.

This simulation offers an immersive experience that can serve as a digital walkthrough for:
- New students
- Visitors
- Anyone unfamiliar with the campus layout

### Key Features:
-  A network of roads laid out across the scene
-  Students walking in different directions across campus paths
-  Cars moving along predefined road routes
-  Camera controls to explore and navigate the environment

Each animated element (students, vehicles) is powered by OpenGL transformations and timers. The road system uses predefined coordinate data and direction logic to handle movement and turning at junctions.

This project highlights:
- 3D graphics rendering
- Real-time animation and interaction
- Educational and interactive design for enhanced spatial understanding

## Scope of the Project

The **Campus Tour** project is an interactive 3D virtual walkthrough of the **Thapar Institute campus**, built using OpenGL. It visually represents major landmarks such as academic blocks, roads, and open areas, giving users a near-realistic and immersive first-person experience.

### Applications:
- **New Students**: Familiarize themselves with the campus layout before arrival
- **Visitors/Parents**: Get a virtual overview of the campus
- **Faculty/Event Organizers**: Understand spatial arrangements

### Technical Highlights:
- 3D object modeling
- Real-time rendering and animation
- Camera navigation and lighting
- Modular, scalable design

The project is lightweight and runs on standard hardware with OpenGL support. It‚Äôs also future-proof, allowing extensions like:
- More buildings
- Labels and annotations
- Clickable info boxes or interactive events

## Features

- Realistic 3D visualization of the campus
- Interactive camera with keyboard and mouse controls
- Buildings like **Library**, **Admin Block**, **CS Block**, **Hostels**, **Hospital**, **Canteen**
- Environmental elements: **trees**, **roads**, **grounds**, **parking**
- Functional areas: **temple**, **football ground**, **basketball court**, **badminton court**
- Modular structure with reusable functions


## Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenGL
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
